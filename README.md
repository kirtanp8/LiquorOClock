# SPIRITSO'CLOCK :cocktail:

A Website for Viewing and Sharing Cocktail Recipes. 

# Project Overview

The task was to create a Django + Python Application, utilising the information we had been taught the week prior. After working in a team for project 3, I wanted to aim for the challenge and see if I could test my own abilities.

#Â Languages/Technologies Used

* HTML5, CSS3
* Bootstrap, Bulma
* JavaScript ES6+
* React
* Python
* Django
* PostgreSQL
* Yarn, NPM
* Git, GitHub

# Mobile View

When you shrink the page, the website doesn't go pear shaped, and  I'm very proud of myself for implementing the below view even though it was a requirement, and when you shrink the page, on any page, the website looks great.

# Secure Routes

Authentication fueled by Django means that users will need to be logged in and registered to the app before they can make use of all the content supplied by the website.

# Recipe Page 

Probably the coolest part of functionality was users being able to save and unsave their recipes. The implementation of a Modal Review form was a cool addition too.

# Profile Page 

Users can see their saved items and the recipes they have added to the database through their profile page. I think I should have made use of the profile picture but didn't really find it neccessary for the website. I think being able to learn how to implement cloudinary and uploading a photo onto a website gave me enough satisfaction.
