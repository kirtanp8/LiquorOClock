# SPIRITSO'CLOCK :cocktail:

A Website for Viewing and Sharing Cocktail Recipes. 

# Project Overview

The task was to create a Django + Python Application, utilising the information we had been taught the week prior. After working in a team for project 3, I wanted to aim for the challenge and see if I could test my own abilities.
